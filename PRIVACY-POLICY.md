# Privacy Policy for Simple Proxy Extension

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Simple Proxy Extension handles your information.

## Data Collection

**Simple Proxy does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

Our extension is designed with privacy in mind and operates entirely on your device. We do not:
- Track your browsing history
- Collect personal information
- Monitor your proxy usage
- Store any data on our servers
- Share any information with third parties

## Chrome Web Store Analytics

The only analytics we receive are the standard, anonymized usage statistics provided by the Google Chrome Web Store. This information is collected and managed by Google, not by us, and includes:

- Number of installations
- Number of uninstallations
- Basic demographic information (country of installation)
- Chrome version statistics

These metrics do not contain any personally identifiable information and are used solely to understand general usage patterns.

## Permissions

Our extension requests only the minimum permissions necessary to function properly:
- The "proxy" permission: Needed to modify proxy settings
- The "sidePanel" permission: Needed to display the extension's side panel

These permissions are used exclusively for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
